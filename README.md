FicZon Inc is an IT solution provider with products ranging from on-premises products to SAAS based solutions.

FicZon business is majorly dependent on the sales force effectiveness. As the market is maturing and more new competitors entering the market, FicZon is experiencing the dip in sales.

Effective sales is dependent on lead quality and as of now, this is based on manual categorization and highly depended on sales staff. Though there is a quality process, which continuously updates the lead categorization, itâ€™s value is in for post analysis, rather than conversation.

FicZon wants to explore Machine Learning to pre-categorize the lead quality and as result, expecting significant increase in sales effectiveness.

## Project Goal:-

Data exploration insights - Sales effectiveness.

ML model to predict the Lead Category (High Potential , Low Potential)

## Challenges Faced:-

1. Analysing the Data:

Most of the columns have a lot of different labels. Therefore we found difficult to alter, expand or to even drop which of the column according to our needs.

2. Data Preprocessing:

Encoding: Since the target variable 'Status' column had lot of outputs, we faced a difficulty in categorizing them into two categories which are low potential and high potential.

Computational Resources: Training and testing the models on a complex dataset requires powerful computing resources and optimization techniques. So we used Data splitting and employed Robust scaler for scaling the data.

3. Model Training and Evaluation:

Model Selection and Interpretation: We found difficult to choose the best model and to understand its predictions can be challenging With various algorithms available.

We found the implementation of model difficult because selecting the most suitable model requires careful consideration.

## Conclusion:-

We have achieved the project goal of effectively plotting the visual representation of the dataset and a machine learning model to predict the lead category.

The project is done with the purpose of finding out the Lead category, and as result, expecting significant increase in sales effectiveness.

After the complete analysis of the dataset, we arrive at the conclusion that Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) is the best suitable output model that gives 73 percent accuracy score, 67% precision score and 65% recall score.
